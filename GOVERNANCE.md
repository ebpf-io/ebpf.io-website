# ebpf.io Governance

An [ebpf.io maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md) is a participant in the project
with the ability to commit code directly to the master repository. 
Commit access grants the ability to affect the shape the architecture 
and content of ebpf.io. Anyone wanting to become a maintainer should
show sustained and relevant contributions to the project.

## Becoming a Maintainer

In the end the decision to grant or revoke committer privileges is 
a judgment call made by the existing set of committers. People can 
become maintainers through nomination by an exisiting maintainer
or self nomination.

## Maintainer Expectations

Maintainers should work to review contributions to the website as 
quickly as possible so PRs don't rot. All contributions should be 
in the interest of the eBPF community and reflect the community's interests.

## Merging Contributions

PRs can be merged after approval by any of the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md).
