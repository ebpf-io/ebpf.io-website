# Contributing changes to [ebpf.io](https://ebpf.io/)

:bee: Thanks for your help improving the project! We are open to any contribution from the community and would love to have you help us make the website better.

## Blog posts

Our blog page includes original blog posts about eBPF, as well as links to external articles hosted elsewhere. If you'd like to submit a blog post to ebpf.io please check that your article meets the following guidelines. We welcome PRs, but if you'd like to discuss a possible submission first please message us on slack in the [#ebpf-website channel])<https://cilium.slack.com/archives/C03TH72HCBW>) or email us [blog@ebpf.io](blog@ebpf.io).

Please see the [full ebpf.io Blog Guidelines](https://github.com/ebpf-io/ebpf.io-website/blob/master/blog-guidelines.md), but in short:

* Posts should be valuable content for the eBPF community
* Posts should not be vendor pitches, and should focus on the open source eBPF project
* Posts hosted on ebpf.io should be original content. You can submit a link to an external article instead of copying content.
* All content is contributed under the CC-BY-4.0 license

Links to posts hosted elsewhere are also given the **External** tag automatically.

See the [Blog Guidelines](https://github.com/ebpf-io/ebpf.io-website/blob/master/blog-guidelines.md) for documentation on how to submit a post or external link.
