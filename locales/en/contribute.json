    "description": "eBPF consists of many communities including the eBPF runtime in the Linux kernel, various development SDKs and libraries, a series of large projects using eBPF, and a wide set of smaller projects and tools. There are therefore many ways to contribute to the eBPF community and get involved. The following list of ideas can serve as a starting point on how you can get involved and contribute to the community.",

      "secondDescription": "Working on the eBPF runtime can be incredibly rewarding as it builds the foundation for software being written that runs on millions of systems and devices. Work includes a wide range of topics from adding support to additional hooks, adding new program types, improvements to the eBPF verifier, adding JIT support for additional CPU architectures, extending the set of BPF helpers, adding new test cases to BPFâ€™s test infrastructure, or improvements to bpftool and libbpf.",
